{"album_id":"1", "track":"1", "lyrics":"Standing at the bus stop with my shopping 
In my hands when I'm overhearing elder 
Ladies as the rumors start to fly you can 
Hear them in the school yard, in the scrap yard 
In the chip shop, in the phone box, in the pool hall at 
The shoe stall every corner turned around
It started with a school girl who was 
Running running home to her mam and 
Dad told them she was playing in the 
Change room of her local football side they 
Said tell us again so she told them again 
They said tell us the truth they found it hard 
To believe 'cause he taught our Steve he 
Even trained me taught uncle john who's 
Father of three
But it only takes one tree to make 
A thousand matches 
Only takes one match to burn 
A thousand trees 
A thousand trees
You see it in the class room in the 
Swimming pool where the matchstick men 
Are made at the scouts hall at the football 
Where the wise we trust are paid they all 
Honor his name he did a lot for the game 
He got his name knocked up above the 
Sports ground gates but now they are 
Ripping them down stamping the ground 
Picture gathers dust behind the bar in the 
Lounge it takes one tree to make
A thousand matches 
Only takes one match to burn 
A thousand trees 
A thousand trees
Wake up and smell the rain shake up he's 
Back to stay he hasn't been on a holiday 
His growing seeds don't believe why he's 
Been away in the school yard change room 
Playing fields bathroom phone box office 
Blocks corner turned around they keep 
Doubting the flame tossing the blame got 
His name knocked up above the sports 
Ground gates but now they're 
Ripping them down stamping the ground 
Picture gathers dust in the bar in the 
Lounge it takes one tree to make
A thousand matches 
Only takes one match to burn 
A thousand trees 
A thousand trees
A thousand trees"},

Close down the street
Yeah Chaplin walks
Be 9:15
And I hear them, hear them call his name
And I see him, see him turn away

They take him in
And clean him up

They take him in 
And strip him down
They dry his skin
And feed him wine
And I hear them, hear them call his name
And I see him, see him turn away

Ask's to use the phone

Yeah he lives alone, he lives alone
There's no one, no one home to phone
He sits alone at home
He call his home his own
His wife is still unknown"},

{"album_id":"1", "track":"3", "lyrics":"I get camping eyes in the final hour 
Last minute shoppers picking cauliflower 
The fuss they make, you'd swear they were buying a car 
They always moan, moan it's not so cheap 
Cheaper still, cheaper still down the street 
Lose my rag and tell them take your bag and shop down there 
Closing down, they're closing down another road 
One way, system steals the show 
Mac the knife swigs a can and sings the day away
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest 
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
The flower man sits down in the street 
Surrounded by, the stock he bought back last week 
Bring back the ladies wearing lipstick on their teeth 
Make up, we make up a crappy joke 
Sit back, relax and have a smoke 
Mac the knife swigs a can and sings the day away
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest 
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest 
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest 
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest

I smell that smell 
It's that time of year again 
I can taste the air 
Clocks go back railway track 
Something blocks the line again 
And the train runs late for the first time
A pebble beach, we're underneath a pier, just been painted red 
Where I hear the news for the first time 
And all the friends lay down the flowers 
Sit on the banks and drink for hours 
Talk of the way they saw him last 
Local boy in the photograph 
He'll always be twenty three 
Yet the train runs on and on 
Past the place they found his clothing
There's no mistake 
I smell that smell 
It's that time of year again 
I can taste the air 
The clocks go back railway track 
Something blocks the line again 
And the train runs late for the first time
And all the friends lay down the flowers 
Sit on the banks and drink for hours 
Talk of the way they saw him last 
Local boy in the photograph 
Today, is gone away"},

{"album_id":"1", "track":"5", "lyrics":"We all face the same way 
Still it takes all day, I take a look to my left
Pick out the worst and the best 
She paints her lip greasy and thick 
Another mirror stare and she's going where?
Another office affair, to kill an unborn scare? 
You talk dirty to a priest, it makes them human at least 
But as you're running away, to start a brand new day? 
Or she going home, why's she driving alone?
Is anyone going anywhere? 
Everyone's gotta be somewhere 
She got a body in the boot, or just bags full of food? 
Those are models legs, bBut are they women's are they men's? 
She shouts down the phone, missed a payment on the loan 
She gotta be above the rest keeping up with the best
Is anyone going anywhere? 
Everyone's gotta be somewhere
Wait tables for a crook? Wrote a hard back book?
You teach kids how to read? Sell your body on the street? 
A nurse without a job? Another uptown snob 
But have I got you wrong? One look and you were gone
Is anyone going anywhere?
Is anyone going anywhere?
Is anyone going anywhere?
Everyone's got to be, somewhere"},

Street orange glow shades the odds against 
One more sip, a shoe, a miss, a shaving nick 
One extra kiss, who's to know whatever!

Not up to me,

Not up to me,
Not up to you
Swings don't swing, the parks been dead for years 
How do you know the last swing 
Weren't your last for good, hard book on freaks fresh summer 
Peach creased magazine, sugar chocolate treat, who's to know whatever!
The street's so long where she lost her pocket purse
Kept the last picture of the man she committed first 
Cracked windscreen rain, french murder play 
Junk take away, tired street parades 
Who's to know whatever!

It's time I tried, tried to check

Check for holes

Re colors her hair and waits for him 
No cat against dog just head over heals 
Sex twice a date best time in years 
Oh no why hasn't he phoned 3
She has to wait until he's on his own 
Lying and denying so no body knows 
I'll tell her this week is what he tells her
To keep her on loan he'll buy her one day
Sex drives oral highs 
Cheated wives and spies 
Cream cakes coffee dates 
Floral gifts goodbye 
Passed away for the day 
Had a change of kind sex changes 
Too mundane for the average mind 
Oh no she just can't see where he is or where he's been
Looked prim and straight like she's always been 
All that she saved for went missing again
She could be wrong 
It looks like the word's got around 
They found a body in the lake 
Maybe it wasn't really his name 
Same color same weight same size feet 
It's the not knowing that kills you 
Oh no the clocks stopped slow 
Every time you're on your own 
Ya' hide from the spies so nobody knows 
Scratch through the pages of the lazy days 
News for a clue still looking for you"},

I'm Drinking like a dog in the sun
I don't need to eat or sleep a wink, at the weekend
Drop my guts
And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
Last of the big time drinkers
The beer don't taste the same without my name painted on my glass
I don't live to work, I work to live, I live at the weekend
I nearly spent a week in the sun
Come home with my bird, sheets thrown out the window
And sunday morning comes
And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink

I take pride in my work

Just give me half a pint of slops
Last of the big time drinkers

Thieving, cheating, beating

Too many sandwiches and wine, sherry stains down your best mans tie, what a speech
The band arrive, the grannies cry, the singers tongue's's in the bar maids mouth, what a voice
Grandpa drunk a drop or two and his head's still stuck down the portaloo, what a man

You bought a sequin dress for your chicken breasts, the discos late and he's overpaid tonight
You got a diamond ring and a man who sings, the man who sings made love to the bar maid twice
And that's just tonight

The bands too loud, they're off down stairs what a noise
The bride and groom they dance their dance
The singer mimes there's still a chance, the bar maid smiles

Another goldfish to drown
Well I just past the bridge
That parts us from them
The bridge that she used
Again and again

I remember when they found her

Word gets around, word gets around
Billy Davey's second daughter
Threw herself to dirty water
Billy's left with nothing but a dream
